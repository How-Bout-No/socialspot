## __Planned Features__
* Changes to overall UI
* Patch theoretical bugs
* Work out impurities in code

## __Support__
This is currently in ALPHA stages at the moment. Code is very messy and likely to implode on itself at any given moment. If you happen to come across any major bugs, or have a feature request, please [Open a New Issue](https://github.com/How-Bout-No/socialspot/issues/new/choose).

## __Known Bugs__
* UI _may_ not scale well to resolutions other than 1920x1080
* Pressing `Enter` while in a text input creates issues
* When using ESX, character changes may not update in UI and cause slight issues
* Sometimes the player name does not show up when private messaging until the plugin is restarted (looking into)
