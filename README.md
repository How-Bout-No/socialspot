This is currently in ALPHA stages at the moment. Code is very messy and likely to implode on itself at any given moment. If you happen to come across any major bugs, or have a feature request, please [Open a New Issue](https://github.com/How-Bout-No/socialspot/issues/new/choose).

## __Known Bugs__

* Pressing `Enter` while in a text input creates issues
